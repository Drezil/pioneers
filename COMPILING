# on ubuntu14.04 (trusty) and later

just run 
> ./build.sh

# manual installation

set up external dependencies:

> sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev
> cd deps && ./getDeps.sh && cd ..

NOTE: ubuntu saucy currently only has libsdl2-dev.2.0.0 in the repositories, but we need libsdl2-dev.2.0.1
      Therefore the update-script gets the updated packages for trusty (which have the same dependencies)
      and installs them.
      PIONEERS WONT RUN WITH VERSION 2.0.0 OF LIBSDL2!

make sure the compiled files are in your PATH (e.g. include $HOME/.cabal/bin in your $PATH)

install dependencies & configure app
> cabal sandbox init
> cabal sandbox add-source deps/hsSDL2
> cabal sandbox add-source deps/hsSDL2-ttf
> cabal install --only-dependencies
> cabal configure

build
> cabal build

run ./Pioneers (symlinked to dist/build/Pioneers/Pioneers)
